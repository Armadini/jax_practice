Jax Notes

What has been hard?
- Making statically defined functions dynamic to data shape
  and model shape...
- Passing random key is annoying
- Having to define structure of pytree
    > This would be realllllllyyy annoying with large models


- Tool to scan for sequences of identical random numbers
